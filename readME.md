# Project overview 

This is a Student Grading application that automates the calculation of current grades for each student in class. The parameters for this application are : <br>
-You're given a short list of four students and their five assignment grades.
-Each assignment grade is expressed as an integer value, 0-100, where 100 represents 100% correct.
-Final scores are calculated as an average of the five assignment scores.
-This application perform basic math opperations to calculate the final grades for each student.
-This application diaplay each student's name and final score.

Currently, the teachers grade book shows the graded assignments for each student as follows : <br>
``` bash
Sophia : 93 , 87 , 98 , 95 , 100
Nicolas : 80 , 83 , 82 , 88 , 85
Zahirah : 84 , 96 , 73 , 85 , 79
Jeong : 90 , 92 , 98 , 100 , 97
```

The output for each student are displayed as follows :

``` bash
student     Grade
Sophia      94.6  A
Nicolas     83.6  B
Zahirah     83.4  B
Jeong       95.4  A
```

To run this project use the following command : 

```bash
dotnet run
```

This is a part of my Microsoft learn Journey.
